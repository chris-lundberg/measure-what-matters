# Description

This repository contains slides for my TiE Denver Business for Breakfast presentation on February 7th, 2020.

The presentation, *What Metrics Matter? A Public Investor's Perspective*, examines three frameworks for investment decision making:

* Qualitative 
* Quantitative
* ESG

These three frameworks are interrelated and should be considered in a holistic decision making process.
